# CryptoClustering - Module 19 Challenge

I used used my Python and Unsupervised Learning methodology to predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes.  This included the K-Means clustering as well as the dimension resampling using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on clustering.

## Elbow Curve Data:

## Scatter Plot Data:

- Scatter plot for the original data clusters:

- Scatter plot for the PCA data clusters:

## Observation:

The analysis of the PCA data had more concentrated cluster vs the original clustered data.  The PCA clusers are far more distinguishable with a more dense distribution leading to the data being more accurate perdiction than that of the origianal data.  Principal Component Analysis is a more accurate method of prediction.
