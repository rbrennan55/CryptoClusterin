# CryptoClustering - Module 19 Challenge

I used used my knowledge of Python and unsupervised learning to predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes.  This included the K-Means clustering as well as the dimension resampling using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on clustering.

### Initial Data

1. Elbow curve for the Initial data.
